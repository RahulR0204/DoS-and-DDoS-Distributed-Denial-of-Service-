# DoS-and-DDoS-Distributed-Denial-of-Service-


This repository discusses Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, specifically focusing on HTTP Floods used by hackers to overwhelm web servers and applications.

## Dos & DDos ( Distributed Denial of Service )

It is also called as HTTP Flood is a type of distributed denial-of-service attack method used by hackers to attack web servers and applications. HTTP Floods work by directing large amounts of HTTP requests at a webpage to overload target servers with requests.

## Preventive Measures

Implement these strategies to mitigate DOS and DDOS attacks:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Set up rate limiting on the WAF to restrict the number of requests from individual IP addresses, mitigating the impact of DDoS attacks that rely on overwhelming the server with requests.

2. **Geo-Blocking**: Block traffic from regions where legitimate users are not expected. This can reduce the attack surface.

3. **Challenge-Response Systems**: Implement challenge-response mechanisms like CAPTCHAs to ensure that incoming traffic is from legitimate users rather than automated bots.

4. **IP Address Blocking**: Block traffic from suspicious or known malicious IP addresses. Creating an IP set match rule to block bad requests based on IP addresses
